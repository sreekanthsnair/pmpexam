    <h1>PMP Beginner Complete Pass Guide 2025</h1>
    <p>This is your full guide to pass the 2025 PMP exam (180 Qs, 4 hrs, need ~122/175 to pass). Covers <strong>People (42%, 75 Qs)</strong>, <strong>Process (50%, 90 Qs)</strong>, <strong>Business (8%, 15 Qs)</strong>. Half is agile (flexible projects). Learn this, practice my 500 Qs, and you’re certified!</p>

        <summary>1. People (42% - About 75 Questions)</summary>
        <h2>Managing Team and People Who Care</h2>
        <p>This is about handling your team and anyone interested (stakeholders). Lots of “what’s your next step?” Qs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Team Conflicts:</strong> Team fighting? Best: talk it out together (collaboration = win-win). Tight on time? Split the difference (compromise). Don’t ignore or force unless stuck.
                <p class="example">Ex: Two devs argue over code—get them to agree, not you decide.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Team Issues:</strong> Someone’s slow or messing up? First, talk privately, offer help (training, tools). Don’t fire, escalate, or add work yet.
                <p class="example">Ex: Designer’s late—ask why, maybe they need software tips.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Team Boost:</strong> Tired team? Say “great job,” give breaks, not more tasks. Happy teams work better.
                <p class="example">Ex: Coders hit milestone—praise them, don’t pile on.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Stakeholders:</strong> Anyone who cares (boss, client, team). List them (stakeholder register), rank them (power/interest grid: boss = high power), update them their way (email, calls).
                <p class="example">Ex: Client wants weekly texts—plan it, don’t skip.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Agile Teams:</strong> Flexible projects? Team picks tasks (self-organizing), you guide, don’t boss. Roles: Product Owner (sets goals), Scrum Master (helps team).
                <p class="example">Ex: Team chooses coding order—you just watch.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Tools:</strong>
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li>RACI: Who does what (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed).</li>
                    <li>Comm Plan: Who gets what info, when (e.g., boss gets reports).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tip">Exam Trick: Q says “conflict” or “slow”? Pick “talk/help” over “fire/escalate.”</p>

        <summary>2. Process (50% - About 90 Questions)</summary>
        <h2>Making the Project Happen</h2>
        <p>Biggest part—planning, tracking, fixing. Math (EVM), agile (half the exam), risks, changes—all here.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>5 Steps:</strong> Start (get okay), Plan (map it), Do (build it), Check (watch it), Finish (wrap up). Every Q fits one.</li>
            <li><strong>Scope:</strong> What’s the job? Write it (charter = start doc), split into tasks (WBS = task list). Extra work? File a change request, don’t just add.
                <p class="example">Ex: Client wants extra app screen—request, don’t jump in.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> List tasks, connect them (A → B), find longest path (critical path = no delays). Speed up: add people (crashing = more $), overlap (fast-tracking = more risk).
                <p class="example">Ex: Design (3d) → Code (4d) = 7d critical path.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Money Math (EVM):</strong> Tracks if you’re on budget/time. Memorize:
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li><strong>CV = EV - AC:</strong> Done (EV) - Spent (AC). + = saving, - = over.</li>
                    <li><strong>SV = EV - PV:</strong> Done - Planned (PV). + = fast, - = late.</li>
                    <li><strong>CPI = EV / AC:</strong> >1 = cheap, <1 = pricey.</li>
                    <li><strong>SPI = EV / PV:</strong> >1 = ahead, <1 = behind.</li>
                    <li><strong>EAC = BAC / CPI:</strong> Total Budget (BAC) / CPI = final cost guess.</li>
                    <li><strong>TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC):</strong> Efficiency to hit budget.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="example">Ex: EV = $50K, AC = $60K, CV = -$10K (over), CPI = 0.83 (bad).</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Risks:</strong> Bad stuff might happen. List them (register), rate them (chance × cost = EMV), fix them (avoid = dodge, mitigate = lessen, transfer = give away, accept = deal). Hits? Use your fix.
                <p class="example">Ex: 40% chance of $20K delay = $8K EMV, plan to lessen.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Agile (40-50 Qs):</strong> Short bursts (sprints = 2-4 weeks), daily chats (15 min), team picks from list (backlog, Product Owner ranks it). No mid-sprint adds—next sprint only.
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li>Roles: Product Owner (goals), Scrum Master (helps), Team (builds).</li>
                    <li>Events: Plan sprint, daily check, show work (review), fix process (retro).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="example">Ex: Boss wants feature mid-sprint—say no, backlog it.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Changes:</strong> Any tweak (scope, time, budget)? File request, get okay (CCB = approval group), update plans. No skipping!
                <p class="example">Ex: Client wants faster—request, don’t rush.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Make it good. Check work (QC = inspect), fix how you work (QA = process). Tools: Pareto (80% problems from 20% causes), Ishikawa (why it broke), Gantt (task bars).
                <p class="example">Ex: App crashes—Pareto finds top bugs.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Buying Stuff:</strong> Fixed-price (set $, seller risks), Cost-plus (you pay extras), T&M (hourly). Delay? Who’s stuck pays.
                <p class="example">Ex: Fixed-price coder late—they fix, not you.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Tools:</strong>
                <ul class="sub-list">
                    <li>WBS: Task breakdown (e.g., app = design, code, test).</li>
                    <li>Gantt: Bar chart of tasks over time.</li>
                    <li>Channels: n(n-1)/2 (5 people = 10 lines).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tip">Exam Trick: Math (10 Qs) = EVM, channels. Agile (40+) = no mid-changes. Always file changes.</p>

        <summary>3. Business (8% - About 15 Questions)</summary>
        <h2>Why We’re Doing This</h2>
        <p>Small but key—links project to company goals and rules.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Match Company Goals:</strong> Project must help (e.g., make $). Goals shift? Check impact, file change—don’t just quit or keep going.
                <p class="example">Ex: Sales drop—see if app still fits, adjust.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Payoff:</strong> What’s the win (cash, happy users)? Write it (business case), check after.
                <p class="example">Ex: App saves time—that’s the win.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rules:</strong> Be fair, honest (PMI Code). Qs test right vs. wrong—pick right.
                <p class="example">Ex: Vendor offers cash—say no, tell boss.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tip">Exam Trick: Ethics Qs (5-10) = always honest. Goal shift = assess.</p>
